This structure now includes the "Docker Architecture" as a separate section, highlighting its significance in the
overall project architecture.

## Introduction

This Data Warehouse project is engineered to facilitate extensive data handling capabilities for financial and
commodities data. It employs advanced Python data engineering techniques, leveraging ORM for efficient data interactions
and providing a RESTful API for data access.

## System Architecture

The architecture is built around Python and Cassandra, with Docker ensuring container management. The integration of
Python ORM simplifies database interactions, converting complex SQL into manageable Python code, enhancing
maintainability and scalability.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or later
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Cassandra
- Virtualenv or any environment management tool

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://yourrepository.com/data-warehouse.git
   cd data-warehouse
   ```

2. **Set up the virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Launch Docker containers:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

5. **Database Initialization:**
   Execute scripts to configure the database schema and seed it with initial data.
